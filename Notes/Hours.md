# Description

## Short Description

Swing the blocks into position to build the electrical grid

## Long Description

Swing the blocks into position to build the electrical grid.

But watch out: If you miss, your grid will malfunction plaguing you with continued problems.

Your city is depending on you to establish a stable grid that can withstand the harsh environment.

The grid must be correctly organized according to the established power sources (which are  logically laid out like a multiplication times table).

Don't destroy the grid!
